1. **Package.json files**: Both the frontend and backend directories have a package.json file. These files share dependencies that are required to run the application. They include libraries such as React for the frontend and Express for the backend.

2. **WeatherService.js and WeatherApiService.js**: These two files share the responsibility of interacting with the external weather API. They would likely share the base URL of the weather API and possibly the API key if one is required.

3. **SearchBar.js and WeatherDisplay.js**: These two frontend components share the state of the application, specifically the current search term and the current weather data. They would likely share a state management solution such as Redux or the built-in React Context API.

4. **App.js**: This is the main frontend file that imports and uses the SearchBar and WeatherDisplay components. It shares the state of the application with these components.

5. **Server.js and weather.js**: These two backend files share the Express application instance. The server.js file creates the instance and the weather.js file uses it to define the weather API endpoint.

6. **Weather.test.js**: This file shares the weather API endpoint with the weather.js file. It uses the endpoint to run tests on the weather API.

7. **README.md**: This file shares the instructions to run the application. It would likely reference the main files of the application such as App.js and server.js.

8. **.gitignore**: This file shares the list of files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. It would likely include the node_modules directories and any environment variable files.

9. **Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml**: These files share the configuration for creating a Docker image of the application and running it with Docker Compose. They would likely reference the main files of the application such as App.js and server.js.

10. **DOM Elements**: The frontend components would share the id names of the DOM elements they manipulate. For example, the search bar might have an id of "search-bar" and the weather display might have an id of "weather-display".

11. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system to communicate between components, the message names would be shared among the components that send and receive the same messages. For example, a "weather-updated" message might be sent by the WeatherService and received by the WeatherDisplay component.
